# LIY Containers using Docker

Container is a buzz word now a days. Everybody is talking about it, everybody wants a containerization expert to handle their microservices. So what are containers, and why it is important to learn it. In this "**LIY - Learn It Yourself**" series, I will be taking you all, through my learning experiences of containerization using Docker, and will try to demystify the air around containerization and docker, also I will help you make your first docker container.

## How to use this "LIY" tutorial :

  - Start from beginning and try to execute all the commands on terminal by typing them yourself. (you learn a lot by typing the commands instead of copying it. Syntax errors..gotcha!!!!)
  - Read everything even if you know it, I may have added an insight. (*you are welcome to comment any insights, that you think should be added, I will be more than happy to add that with your reference.*)
  - Learning to code is like learning Maths, the more problems you solve the more you learn.

## Pre-requisites :

  - Common Sense (> this is most important pre-requisite in all spheres of life.)
  - Unix/Linux knowledge.
